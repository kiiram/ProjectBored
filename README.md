# ProjectBored
A little data project (2023)

## Goals

**The goal of this project was to** 
  1) Connect to an open API and query data: In this project, [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/) was used.
  2) Process and save the data locally using Python.
  
Additional goals for the project were 
- To learn to use Git and connect the local repository to GitHub. 
- To learn to build an Anaconda environment for all needed Python packages for easier dependency management.


Future updates could include sending the activity for each day via an email.
